## Implemented:
- __tcache_poisoning:__ trick malloc into returning an arbitrary pointer by abusing tcache freelist.
- __bin2stack:__ exploit the overwrite of a freed chunk on an unsorted bin freelist to return a nearly-arbitrary pointer. this will only work with disabled tcache-option for glibc or the size of the victim chunk is larger than 0x408, see build_glibc.sh for build instructions.

## TODO:
- __glib_first_fit:__ demonstrate glibc malloc's first-fit behavior
- __tcache_index_calc:__ demonstrate glibc's tcache index calculation.
- __fastbindup:__ trick malloc into returning an already-allocated heap pointer by abusing the fastbin freelist
- __unlink:__ exploit free on a corrupted chunk to get arbitrary write.
- __free_fastbin:__ frees a fake fastbin chunk to get malloc to return a nearly-arbitrary pointer.
- __fake_fastbin:__ gain remote code execution via fake fastbins
